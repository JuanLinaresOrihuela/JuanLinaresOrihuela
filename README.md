### Juan Linares Orihuela 👋

**'Computer Science Student (Developer)'**

I am on a mission to become a software engineer dedicated to crafting innovative solutions that tackle everyday challenges and simplify lives. My passion lies in iOS Development, where I get to blend my creativity and technical skills to create amazing user experiences.

Currently, I'm juggling a busy schedule, balancing coursework, and a full-time teaching job while pursuing my dream of becoming a software engineer. In my pursuit of excellence, I've embarked on an exciting journey by enrolling in the prestigious Full Stack JavaScript Bootcamp at Grand Circus in Detroit, Michigan. This intensive program is helping me master the skills required to build robust, end-to-end web applications.

But that's not all! I love a good challenge, which is why I'm currently competing at HackMIT and gearing up for another thrilling competition at HackHarvard in the coming weeks. These hackathons not only fuel my passion for coding but also allow me to collaborate with brilliant minds from around the world to create innovative solutions.

On this GitHub profile, you'll find a showcase of my projects, contributions, and the evolution of my skills as I work toward my goal of becoming a top-notch software engineer. Feel free to explore and connect with me as I embark on this exciting journey of learning, coding, and making a positive impact on the world through technology. Let's innovate together! 💻🌟
